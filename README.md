# flutter_application_1

A new Flutter project. This app shows a basic pokedex of gen 1 pokemon. All pokemon are showed in grid view and you can click on them to get more details about them.
Right now, the app shows the data of three pokemon arranged in cards in column. The data is hardcoded right now so no active updates.

# TO-DO
Use pokemon API to fetch the data remotely and make it changable/updatable to get more data/more pokemon as well.

Update:
Finish the TO-DO above and created a new repo for it. Also added a nice readme file showing the screenshots of the app working.
