# flutter_application_1

A new Flutter project. This app shows a basic pokedex of gen 1 pokemon. All pokemon are showed in grid view and you can click on them to get more details about them.
Right now, the app shows the data of three pokemon arranged in cards in column. The data is hardcoded right now so no active updates.

# TO-DO
I have used pokemon API to fetch the data remotely and it can be changed/updated to get more data/more pokemon as well.
